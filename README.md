# Music Genre Predictor
We are in an age in which we have millions of option for music and limited time to decide whether we like or dislike a song, it would be sad if we miss out on some excellent songs, because we didnâ€™t tumble upon them accidently, while creating a collection which we will be using for years to come.<br />
Genre recommendation, can be used in music recommendation, automated radio, something new to explore and many more options.<br />
The purpose of this project is to find relation between songs and its genre, and create a model which can predict whether a song belongs to Folk, Electronic, Pop or Rock genre.
